## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned
Basic folder structer for web development.  Created a styles folder for my css file.  Completely
reworked the css file.  I used flexbox to center the content. 
I made variables for colors and fonts.  Focused on combing selectors when they shared the same properties.

### Continued development
Keeping an organized consistnet approach with a folder structures and css.
